        1. In lab 1 use the Unix/Mac settings when working in the IDE. The online IDE is a virtual Linux machine.
        2. In lab 1, you do not need to donwload ruby. It comes with the CS50 IDE.
        3. In order to start lab 2 simply click on the tutorial package link to download it. Then from your computer, drag and drop the zip file into your "~/" folder in your ide. Then use the following command "unzip git_tutorial.zip". after this command you should see a folder called git_tutorial in your folders on the left hand side of your IDE.
