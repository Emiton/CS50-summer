## Accounts to sign up for

    * We will be using Piazza as a location to ask questions. You can ask questions publicly or make questions private so that only the instructors can see them.  
5. Create an account with [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This is the video service that we will be using for remote tutoring sessions. Zoom also allows you to share your screen during video chats. It may ask you to download the desktop app.
