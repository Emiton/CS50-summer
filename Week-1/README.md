## Intro
Hello all and welcome to Week 1 (the second week) of the CS50 summer program.  
This week we will be finally be getting into some code. This week you will have two tasks to complete.

## TODO - Due Sunday 6/16/19  
1. [Watch CS50 lecture 1](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/courseware/bdc606f10e7347f6a61a341c4544bbf7/71a3739357a54a0e81348468341214b3/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AHarvardX%2BCS50%2BX%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%40f60c7cd5dc304c689580a67adc015e41)  
2. [Complete Problem Set 1](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/1/pset1.html). Follow the instructions in the link provided. Make sure to create a folder named "pset1". Complete all of your work inside of this folder.  
    * P1. Complete `Hello`
    * P2. Complete `Mario` less comfortable or more comfortable
    * P3. Complete `Cash` or `Credit`
**Note:** If you are feeling comfortable with the work, please go ahead and complete all of the problems. What is listed above is mandatory, but feel free to do all of the problems for practice. We encourage it!  

## Tips and tricks
* __How to make a file:__ In order to make in a file in your command line, use the command `touch <filename>`. For example to create a file named hello.c you will type `touch hello.c`.  
* __How to open a file:__ In order to open a file in the editor type `open <filename>`. For example to open the file hello.c you would type `open hello.c`. This should open the file in a text editor that you can edit the file in.  
* __How to check style:__ When writing code, you want to use a consistent formatted style. In order to check if your code is properly formatted use the command `style50`. For example, to check the style of a file named hello.c, you would type `style50 hello.c`
* __How to check your code:__ In order to check if your code is correct, you will use `check50`. Each problem will show you how to use check50 in the submission details. Make sure to run check5o in the same folder where your code is.  
* __Process for writing code__
    1. If you make changes to a file in a text editor, always make sure to save the file. Unlike Microsoft Word or Google Docs, the text editor __WILL NOT__ save changes for you.
    2. After saving your code, use the command `make <filename>` to *compile* your code. *Compiling* is a step which takes your code and turns it into a special file type that the computer can execute. If you make changes to your code, make sure to **SAVE AND COMPILE AGAIN**. You must save and recompile everytime!
    3. After compiling your code, you can run it! If your filename was hello.c, then after compiling you can run your program by typing `./hello`. Notice how we are using a dot and a forward slash and dropping the ".c" part of our program.
