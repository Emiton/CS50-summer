## Intro
Hello all,  
This week we will be learning about arrays and strings. We will be taking everything we learned last week and applying it to cryptography problems.

## TODO - Due Sunday 
1. [Watch CS50 week 1 continued lecture](https://video.cs50.net/2017/fall/lectures/2?t=0m1s)
2. [Complete Problem Set 2](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/2/pset2.html). The instructions on the problem set will tell you to complete any two of the problems presented, but make sure that you complete the following 2 problems. Make sure to create a folder called "pset2" and complete all of your work in that folder.
    * Complete `Caesar`
    * Complete `Vigenere`
    * You can complete `Crack` if you like, but it is not mandatory

## Tips and Tricks
* Here is a link to an [ascii chart](http://www.asciichart.com/). This will be quite useful when completing the problem set.  

If you have any questions, make sure to post on the Piazza page! This way everyone can benefit from your inquiry. We're all in this together!
