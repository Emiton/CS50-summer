# Intro  
Hello all and welcome to week 3 of the CS50 summer program. This week we will be learning about strings, searching, and sorting. We'll also be writing a program which can play music!
# TODO
1. [Watch CS50 week 2 lecture](https://video.cs50.net/2017/fall/lectures/3?t=0m3s)  
2. [Complete Problem Set 3](https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/psets/3/pset3.html)
# Tips and Tricks
* You don't need to know much music theory to get through this problem set. The main thing you should focus on is how many __*"steps"*__ does it take to get from one key to another. This will be main thing driving your algorithm.
